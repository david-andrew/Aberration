# Silver Void

![Silver Void](cover_art.png)

A realistic-physics space shooter where you and a fleet of ships battle against an opposing fleet.


Made for Acerola Jam 0 (theme "Aberration"), enemies lead their shots so that bullets will hit where you are going to be, unless you continually thrust onto a new trajectory.
